CS-350 - Emerging Sys Arch & Tech (Embedded Software Programming)
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The project was to create a smart thermostat with a variety of functionality, including buttons that turned temperature up or down, LED display to indicate heat was on or not, using UART to simulate sending data to server, and a timer to drive this functionality. The project also included a report on the project demonstrating that it meets the business requirements and technical specifications, as well as a proposal for how to connect this thermostat to the cloud.

What did you do particularly well?

I did a good job approaching the project with planning and care. I used pseudocode and diagrams to plot out what the project would look like and worked far in advance, which allowed me to have most elements completed well in advance of the deadline.

Where could you improve?

It feels fairly strong overall, but I could possibly revisit the task schedule element and find a more elegant code to replace what I used, but mine functioned perfectly so I left it as is for the time being.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I definitely feel more comfortable with embedded programming, as well as some of the tools to find aid online (ranging from documention for the specific board/hardware components to subreddits and specific YouTube channels).

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

Combining many different elements of code (timer, GPIO, UART, I2C, task scheduler, etc) was really helpful for practicing writing good, modular code. Practice with diagrams and state machines was also really helpful and potentially useful in many other scenarios.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

In addition to exercising care to keep each bit of code modular, which helps with all the above, I also tried to include careful comments and easily understandable variables/method names to make the project easy to come back to or to identify to someone unfamiliar with the work.
